# Polymer nanocomposites ML Model

Repository supporting the Master’s thesis project  
**“Design and Application of a Computational Model for Estimating the Mechanical Properties of ABS Reinforced with Carbonaceous Nanofillers.”** 
Created in **2025** during an internship, this work focuses on developing a supervised Machine Learning model to estimate key mechanical properties of ABS+GNP nanocomposites.
